
Project: 1

As a part of project team, you are required to create a COBOL application that would take in a PS file as its input and update
the KSDS master file based on the entries given in the PS file.
Employees Master records are maintained in a KSDS dataset called EMASTER which records the following fields.
 
    EMPID     ENAME     DEPT     SALARY     PH-NO

Organization maintains a PS dataset called as WorkFile which maintains their daily request of recording new employee joining, 
change of personal information, department or salary change from HR team.

    Use the PS file as input file which is given with the following details.
    EMPID     ENAME     DEPT     SALARY     PH-NO      STATUS     REMARKS
    10001     XYZ       SALES    50000      044-123456   I
    10023     ABC       ACCT     50000      044-123456   U
    10012     PQR       FINS     50000      044-123456   D
    (Hint: minimum 15 records has to be present)

Write a COBOL program to read records from the above given PS dataset and verify the status.
if Status is 'I' then insert details from EMPID to PH-NO into the EMASTER dataset and update the PS file status to 'F'
indicating finished for sucess or 'P' indicating as Pending for unsuccess and give the remarks.
if Status is 'U' then modify that record in KSDS with the given values in PS file and change the PS file status to 'F'
indicating finished for sucess or 'P' indicating as Pending for unsuccess and give the remarks.
if Status is 'D' then delete that record from KSDS and change the PS file status to 'F' indicating finished for sucess or 
'P' indicating as Pending for unsuccess and give the remarks.

Remarks should be
1. 'Success' for all successful operations.
2. Appropriate error message based on the returned file status code.

    Hint: After the execution of above program PS will be as below
    EMPID     ENAME     DEPT     SALARY     PH-NO      STATUS     REMARKS
    10001     XYZ       SALES    50000      044-123456   P        Records already present
    10023     ABC       ACCT     50000      044-123456   P        Records not found
    10012     PQR       FINS     50000      044-123456   F        Success

  Create a KSDS named EMASTER using below code:

    //WPR109A JOB WIPRO,SUSI,CLASS=A,NOTIFY=&SYSUID      
    //STEP1 EXEC PGM=IDCAMS                              
    //SYSIN DD *                                         
              DEFINE CLUSTER(                        -   
                      NAME(WPR109.MAR11.EMASTER)    -   
                      INDEXED                        -   
                      KEYS(5,0)                      -   
                      RECORDSIZE(80,80)              -   
                      CYL(1,1)                       -   
                   )                                     
    /*                                                   
    //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*     

  Insert values into ksds using below code:

    //WPR109A JOB WIPRO,SUSI,CLASS=A,NOTIFY=&SYSUID   
    //STEP1 EXEC PGM=IDCAMS                           
    //DD1 DD DSN=WPR109.MAR11.PS3,DISP=OLD           
    //DD2 DD DSN=WPR109.MAR11.EMASTER,DISP=OLD       
    //SYSIN DD *                                      
           REPRO INFILE(DD1) OUTFILE(DD2)             
    /*                                                
    //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
